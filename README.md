# ComfySloth
A responsive E-commerce website completed by me based on a React 18 course project when learning ReactJS. It has a landing page, an about page, a product page and also a cart page. The products are being fetched from a custom api and shown on the website. Products can be filtered in several way and can also be added to the cart. It offers a login and logout option using auth0 integration, even if the checkout option is still missing, where users can login using their Google account. 

The project is mainly done to learn the features of React JS and how to use them in a real life application. 
I leveraged the provided resources, guidance, and instructions to create the project. 
Throughout the project, I actively implemented my own ideas, made necessary modifications, and ensured its successful completion.
